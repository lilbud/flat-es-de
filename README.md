Theme 'Flat' - 2023-03-14 by Lilbud

Port of my original Flat theme to the new EmulationStation-DE. Thanks to the ES-DE Discord for helping me out with the new theming system. 

Note: The colors are different because I got them from a repository, rather than picking them manually. The original theme only supported like 60 systems, and the default for ES-DE is like 170. So, getting colors for all of them would be far too much.

Light and Dark colorSchemes included, as well as auto-switching to a "basic" layout when there is no media
